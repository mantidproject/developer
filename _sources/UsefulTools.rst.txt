Creating classes: class_maker.py
--------------------------------

**To make it faster to create a new class**. This is a small python
script located in /buildconfig/. It generates the .cpp, .h and test
files for a class along with some code stubs. It can also flesh out more
methods for new Algorithms, using the "--alg" option.

::

    usage: class_maker.py [-h] [--force] [--test] [--alg] SUBPROJECT CLASSNAME
    Utility to create Mantid class files: header, source and test.
    positional arguments:
     SUBPROJECT  The subproject under Framework/; e.g. Kernel
     CLASSNAME   Name of the class to create
    optional arguments:
     -h, --help  show this help message and exit
     --force     Force overwriting existing files. Use with caution!
     --test      Create only the test file.
     --alg       Create an Algorithm stub. This adds some methods common to
                 algorithms.

Moving/Renaming classes: move_class.py
--------------------------------------

This python script is located in in /buidconfig/. It will move a class
from one subproject to another and/or rename the class. Namespaces and
cmakelists are adjusted. For details, run:

``buildconfig/move_class.py --help``

Deleting a class: delete_class.py
---------------------------------

This python script is located in in /buildconfig/. It will delete a
class from one subproject. CMakeList.txt is adjusted. For details, run:

``buildconfig/delete_class.py --help``

Leak checking etc
-----------------

Linux
~~~~~

`Memcheck <http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/mc-manual.html>`__

-  Keeps track of allocs/deallocs and reports anything missing at exit.
-  Slow but thorough
-  Useful options to run with

``valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes --num-callers=20 --track-fds=yes --track-origins=yes --freelist-vol=500000000 ``\ \ `` [args...]``

Windows
~~~~~~~

`Visual Leak Detector <https://vld.codeplex.com/releases>`__

#. Setup the additional paths as defined in the readme file
#. Adjust the configuration file, "C:\Program Files\Visual Leak
   Detector\vld.ini" to output to both File and debugger by changing the
   ``ReportTo`` to

``ReportTo = both``

#. Add #include <vld.h> to the system.h file in Kernel
#. Compile everything in debug
#. Running unit tests should now create a file memory_leak_report.txt in
   the test directory.
#. IMPORTANT remove the #include <vld.ini> before checking in.

Thread checking
---------------

`Helgrind <http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/hg-manual.html>`__ or  `drd <http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/drd-manual.html>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Identifies race conditions & dead-locks
-  Slow but accurate
-  A pain to get working with OpenMP. GCC must be recompiled to use a different call to create OMP threads or helgrind/drd cannot "see" the thread calls. Use this `script <https://github.com/UCSCSlang/Adversarial-Helgrind/raw/master/drd/scripts/download-and-build-gcc>`__ to recompile the same version off gcc that is onyour system. The script will need editing to change the appropriate variables.

Profiling
---------

.. _linux-1:

Linux
~~~~~

`Callgrind/KCachegrind <http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/show.cgi/KcacheGrindIndex>`__

-  KCachegrind visualizes callgrind output.
-  See :ref:`Profiling With Valgrind <ProfilingWithValgrind>` for help on
   running callgrind

`gperftools <https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools>`__

-  Takes snapshot of run and prints percentage of calls in functions

See here for a list of other tools:

.. _windows-1:

Windows
~~~~~~~

`Very Sleepy <http://www.codersnotes.com/sleepy/>`__ (Windows):

-  Start/stop recording of program using a button
-  Not as detailed or flexible as callgrind

IWYU
----

`include what you
use <https://code.google.com/p/include-what-you-use/>`__ (iwyu) is a
clang-based tool for determining what include statements are needed in
C/C++ files. Below are instructions for getting it to run with mantid on
linux which is a filled in version of `this
bug <https://code.google.com/p/include-what-you-use/issues/detail?id=164>`__.

#. Install the software. The version available from system installs
   should be fine (e.g. yum or apt-get).
#. Get a copy of
   `iwyu_tool.py <https://code.google.com/p/include-what-you-use/source/browse/trunk/iwyu_tool.py>`__
   which is in the project's repository, but may not be installed if you
   got it from your operating system locations (e.g. yum).
#. Run ``cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=TRUE``. This will
   generate an extra file, ``compile_commands.json``, in your build area
   which has instructions on compiling every file in mantid.
#. Run :literal:`iwyu_tool.py -p `pwd` 2> iwyu.log` to generate the
   report of changes redirecting into the file ``iwyu.log``. This will
   take a long time since it is going through the whole repository. If
   you want it for a single file, then supply that as an additional
   argument with full path. Only one file can be supplied at a time.
#. Run ``fix_includes < iwyu.log`` and compile the results. Depending on
   how you installed iwyu, the program may be called
   ``fix_includes.py``. If it doesn't compile, the most likely suspect
   is that iwyu included a private header. See `iwyu instructions for
   users <https://code.google.com/p/include-what-you-use/wiki/InstructionsForUsers#How_to_Run>`__
   for ways to handle this. Generally, they suggest deleting the
   offending lines.
#. Check that your build path didn't make it into source files. Since
   ``compile_commands.json`` has full paths, iwyu will put full paths in
   the include statements. This will not produce an error on your
   system, but it will on the build servers. The easiest way to check is
   to use `the silver
   searcher <https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher>`__ to check
   for your username in your source tree.
#. Enjoy your success.

**Note:** ``iwyu`` outputs to ``stderr`` and always returns a failure
status code since it generates no output. The output stream also affects
``iwyu_tool.py``
