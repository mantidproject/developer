Release 3.2.0 sees the inclusion some of the requests raised by the Scientific Steering Committee back in January.

Major improvements to the documentation have been made in this release with a cleaner and more accessible website, better offline help, and improvements to the algorithm and fit function descriptions. On the code side we have also made a real step to making our workflow algorithms much less of a "black box", you can now unroll the history of any workflow algorithm to see the steps it performed, and script these out in case you want to make changes.
