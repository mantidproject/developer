<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The standards are the header titles and can be used standalone.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For most developers looking for something to link to / follow at a glance
the table of contents will have everything you need.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Each standard has bullet points accompanying it for quick guidance if required.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If your unsure about a standard the bullet points should help give some pointers
related to that point. Feel free to skim as required to jog your memory.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Additional explanation, clarification and justification is provided after.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a larger commentary on why / what for people looking to either learn
or go into detail. It’s not expected people read this if they are already
comfortable with the associated standard or points.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3" role="doc-backlink">Overview</a><a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are multiple approaches to GUI design and implementation within the Mantid codebase. The aim of this document is to adhere to these agreed standards for future GUI work.</p>
<p>Existing GUIs in Mantid may differ, so developers should follow the existing conventions where they are established. Each GUI will have a document explaining these differences, as explained later in the document.</p>
<p>This document should not be used as a reason to rewrite swathes of GUI code, except for cases where the effort to match established patterns, now or in the future, exceeds the work required to move to these standards.</p>
<p>Developers should follow these guidelines when writing new interfaces as closely as possible. There may be times where it’s more appropriate to deviate from these standards, but like all standards this must be justified on a case-by-case basis in the associated PR.</p>

<p>Feel free to do these on whatever medium works best for you, be it tools
like Balsamiq (licenses available), the back of the envelope, a whiteboard

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use this mockup to pretend you’re interacting with the actual GUI.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Go through the process you expect a user to do, show drop downs, radio buttons
and tabs. You’ll be surprised how many clunky design choices this will show
you before anything is written.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Don’t prototype with real code</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The temptation is there to just go ahead and adapt your prototype. This
is going to take a lot of time to do, and is unfair on your reviewer. A
five minute sketch is a lot more comfortable to critique than a 3 hour prototype.</p>

</ul>
<p>First and foremost we are a scientific tool. It’s easier to validate the results
we produce in a separate PR without trying to figure out what the GUI
might have broke.</p>
<p>Don’t be tempted to work on the GUI simultaneously, for your users’ and your
benefit. Having something they can run from Python whilst you’re putting the
finishing touches to the GUI will allow them to process data for their users
and allow you to deliver a fantastic product.</p>

single page for accessibility. This <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/this-is-what-happens-when-you-let-developers-create-ui/">article</a> shows you (and
discusses briefly) what the end result is. A window with 30+ “convenient”
buttons is only useful once you memorise them and useless to external users.</p>
<p>Follow design principles provided in the training section and push back
if required when scope creep starts to happen. The later it’s recognised the
harder it becomes to fix, yet the more problems it causes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Design docs should be reviewed by another dev</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Anecdotally one common cause of bugs is “…logic kept getting added to existing code”</p></li>
<li><p>It’s hard to step back and assess if you’re suffering from scope creep, so do it often</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As developers enjoy writing new features (well at least most of us), we get
into <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_fever">Go Fever</a> and don’t stop
to reflect on what we’re working on.</p>
<p>Periodically step back, look at your design documents and ask, “does this fit in?”
Better still talk to a nearby co-developer, interested user or rubber duck
debugging device. Describe what features were already there and tell them about
this new feature, do they sound like they fit in the same place?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When it doubt, split it out</p></li>
<li><p>An eager split is easier to fix than a split too late</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When you think the scope of your current file / directory is growing too far
split it out early. Especially with UI files, the later you leave it the
harder it becomes to unpick everything.</p>
<p>If you split, then it turns out the work completed wasn’t as large as anticipated
it’s as simple as moving your imports, then cutting and pasting code
and tests across. This is much easier than the other way where you have to
unpick all the callers in the same file and shared variables.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Feel free to create helper classes where required</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Especially with models, the logic can grow quickly and become difficult to
test too. If you can justify the scope of the model then look into delegating
work to classes which each have a single responsibility.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a lot of logic to work out what titles to put on
various plot windows consider moving it to a PlottingWindowTitles helper class
with its own associated test.</p>

<li><p>Don’t rewrite the world because you don’t like how it looks</p></li>
<li><p>Look at the maintenance docs and check new work conforms during the PR process</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each GUI should have an associated maintenance guide with it. The conventions
might be incorrect, weird or downright wrong. However, consistency is key to
helping future you and everyone else who works on the GUI maintain some level of
understanding.</p>
<p>One temptation we get as developers is to rewrite something we don’t understand,
this isn’t to deny the fact that some code is….difficult… These
standards are a result of those mistakes, but we don’t have time to go back
and put the world to right.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If you’re spending excessive time fixing bugs / maintaining code discuss modernising</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is beyond the scope of these standards, but don’t feel like everything
is set in stone and you’ve been prescribed to draw proverbial blood from said stone.
If you’re spending excessive time fixing bugs or maintaining code raise
these concerns in the project management chain for the possibility of rewriting.</p>

</ul>
<p>It’s been said that the best developers write the least code, however in this case
it works against them. That simple if statement which changes whether a
check-box is enabled should be in the model. Often a simple if statement in the
presenter gets some new checks added…etc. until it becomes a hidden model.</p>
<p>Suddenly you’ll end up having to pry out a model from the presenter,
taking significantly more time than that first bit of work saved.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Always have a 1:1 mapping between GUI and algorithm</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Reflectometry used the N algs to one GUI mapping. This initially appears like
a good idea, since it reduces the code per workflow algorithm.
However, long-term you now have N entry points to test separately and
maintain.</p>
<p>Having a single algorithm that handles the workflow associated with your GUI
keeps it trivial to maintain, and also helps you maintain another standard;
the workflow algorithm must work without the GUI.</p>

</ul>
<p>Firstly, having a single method in your presenter handle every notification
means you can put a single break-point when debugging. Imagine a future dev
trying to figure out why that field in the GUI keeps changing,
but no breakpoints hit because you made another notification handler. Now
imagine you’re that future dev…..</p>
<p>The other aspect is having a single method that’s growing beyond 30 lines
is painfully obvious. Maybe you have some dead code paths that need to be
trimmed out, maybe you are suffering from scope creep or maybe your notifier
is doing model logic. In any case it’s easier to spot now rather than
in 5 different places.</p>

</ul>
<p>To use a cliché, when you have a hammer suddenly everything looks like a
nail: Many developers will use conversions (hammer) at the last second to
coerce their type (nail) into something “standard” which the rest of the
code-base uses at the point they need it.</p>
<p>You only notice something is wrong when you’ve put in so many conversions that
it’s either hard to keep track of what the type is at this point (Python), or
you can’t see into them debugging (C++).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Convert to a standard type in the view, not the presenter</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The view is the boundary between your code and external code you have no control
of. Do the conversion at the point return something, that way it’s obvious
in the presenter which types you’re working with.</p>
<p>If the structure is quite complex such as a class containing multiple related
fields consider packing it into your own struct (C++) or POD class (Python).
That way these Qt classes don’t leak into your tests either where you need
a more complex type.</p>

<li><p>Don’t let Qt / Plotting bleed in</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s tempting to check if plotting still plots, or Qt still Qts. But leave
that to the project / teams responsible and test up to the API call only.</p>
<p>Keep your API calls to things you cannot test in the view, and keep the logic
in the model. The idea is that the presenter should be doing calls like,
“here is a workspace and figure, go plot that workspace on that figure”.
The dumber the logic the less likely it will break.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you test with only mocks?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a good litmus test, a presenter should not have tests that do
ASSERT_EQUAL, as that’s probably doing logic. The model (which you’ve tested
previously), should just return the right thing.</p>
<p>Your tests should check that the presenter blindly accepts from the model or
view and forwards to the opposite, unmodified. The easiest way is to mock a
return value from the view/model, and check that’s passed in as a parameter to
the model/view as is.</p>

<li><p>Ultimately good organisation of these chains is ultimately key</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Having a big chain of observers notifying each other tends to happen implicitly;
multiple presenters or views are wired up to notify on value changed. This then
changes yet more values and cascades.</p>
<p>Existing GUIs (such as Reflectometry) avoids this by having a presenter which
handles all notifications. It’s obvious who is notifying who, and how far
the chain can extend.</p>

<p>As the number of signals you accept grows using primitives can quickly cause
problems: was 1 this signal or that, what does a blank string mean? …etc.</p>
<p>This is used in combination with having a single notification point, if you
need multiple enums or your current enum class is growing you are likely
suffering scope creep. Step back and consider if your GUI has gone beyond
its initial design.</p>

</ul>
<p>Take the time out to write an observer pattern, this can be combined
to also satisfy the rule of having a limit of chains by using a single presenter
that handles everything.</p>
<p>This incurs an initial cost of writing the observer, but quickly you can
mock out the implementation saving you manually testing it in the future.
Later on when your co-developers are fighting Qt firing a signal but not
slots reacting you can point to your observer pattern that either just works
or fails with a nice stack trace.</p>

<p>Before and after starting work developers should be estimating. However, GUIs

For example, what happens if you need to redo some of your UX design, or
it turns out that new feature Y will require us splitting our work from GUI X?</p>
<p>Take the time to talk to other developers within your team about the work you
think will be required, and what might come up in the best and worst case.</p>
<p>Likewise after the work is completed feedback on what you were right and wrong
about and take it forward to your next chunk of GUI work. Maybe you’re on the
cusp of having to split a file and any extra features will force you to do it
or you’ve spent extra time refactoring last time so it should be quicker next.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are you solving a symptom for a user, rather than their actual problem?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What separates a good product from a great one from a user perspective is
recognising what problem someone is trying to solve rather than the symptoms.
Taking a step back and asking what problem someone is trying to solve can
sometimes yield better solutions, such as writing a script or tweaking a
workflow algorithm.</p>
<p>For example, are they asking for a tick box for something which is almost always
true except for once a year? In this case can we add an option to the
workflow alg but not the GUI, that way most users can’t get it wrong. Then write
a script which does it once a year for those power users who need that feature.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Newer devs: talk to more experienced devs, ask if there is a better way to do stuff</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Invite them along to your user meetings to sit back and help. They should not
be there to run your meeting or take over. Instead they might recognise something
that another group has done, a potential problem or even a hidden
solution.</p>
<p>Feel comfortable saying no (in gentler terms) whenever you think something is
unreasonable, raise concerns and suggest alternatives. Users would rather not
see multiple months wasted on something they thought was trivial to do, as
there can be a disconnect between perceived and actual difficulty.
An extreme example might be a bespoke GUI for a single user when a script
would be perfectly adequate.</p>
<p>When in doubt raise it through your management chain, they’re there to help!</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Experienced devs: check the dialogue is happening</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ask to go to meetings with newer devs until you feel like they can recognise
the various components and tools available from Mantid for solving problems.</p>
<p>Check that the requirement gathering, estimation process and UX design steps
are being done with the group. Encourage developers to partake in negotiating
what work is appropriate and where it should be scheduled.</p>
<p>Watch out for things being added mid-sprint silently, newer devs can feel
obligated to complete the planned work in addition to the extra work. This
can cause burn out and setup an unofficial mechanism where requests will bypass
the sprint planning mechanism.</p>

<ul class="simple">

</ul>
<p>If you’re adding tests to existing code or require major refactoring work
consider adding a factory class which allows you to get all your dependencies.
This is injected instead and the constructor calls a builder method for each
dependency, the testing class will inherit and override to inject mocks.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Last resort is to create a test class as a friend of the presenter</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This should be considered a last resort as it also opens an avenue for manipulating
the internals of the class under test conditions. Tests which manipulate internals are
no longer testing a public API and are usually a sign you have a helper class
lurking inside.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You may have a problem with the entry point code for production</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Look at the maintenance guide or dev documentation, some interfaces will use
a top window view which creates the real instances to inject into its children.
By keeping it in the view (not model or presenter) we follow the standard,
if you can’t test it put it in the view.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You should use DI in Python too! This will also future proof you for growth too.</p></li>
<li><p>Use this over patching wherever possible</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Patching can be difficult to get right, resulting in lots of copy and paste
code. Instead DI can be done once in the setup method of your unit test class.
This will make it easier to add new tests in the future too since you’ve
already done the work in your setup.</p>
<p>Getting the path right can be difficult and developers have to learn
various rules about how things are imported into different namespaces, which
are only really used for patching tests.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For existing code can you let init run then replace it?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Python allows you to reach into a class’s internals and replace them. Consider
replacing the attribute with a mock. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># View needs to be mocked but no DI available</span>
<span class="n">presenter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MyPresenter</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="c1"># Injected the view without using mocks</span>
<span class="n">presenter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">view</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Mock</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note this shouldn’t be used in lieu of dependency injection through the
constructor since it will hide the code smell of feature creep</p>

<p>Having one or two very generic methods handle all calls to an API will
mean if it ever broke it would break everything in your GUI at once, making it

</ul>
<p>It’s very easy to have a for loop in a view which starts off iterating
through a list then adding extra steps while you’re there. The view should
have this all pre-prepared for it in a way that any for loops take an object,
unpack it and forward it to an API only.</p>
<p>For example, if you need to group 12 items into 3 boxes of 4 in the view
don’t put the grouping into the view. Instead pack them into a list of lists
or create a new struct (C++) / POD class (Python) to hold this and iterate
through that instead.</p>

(see <a class="reference internal" href="#keep-qt-in-view"><span class="std std-ref">Keep Qt / Plotting in the view</span></a> ) then they can stay.</p>
