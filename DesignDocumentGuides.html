<p>A good design document minimises unexpected complications by addressing
them before the code is written. A document will provide you, your
manager and your team with a common vocabulary for talking about the
project. Writing an effective design document can be tricky in itself, as
they often add unnecessary complexity if not done with care. These
guidelines are to help with when and how to generate effective and simple design
documents.</p>
<div class="section" id="when-to-write-a-design-document">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">When to write a design document</a><a class="headerlink" href="#when-to-write-a-design-document" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section provides some guidelines on when to produce a design document.
Note that, it is not about when to do a design and when not.
Except for trivial changes, one should always perform design work before coding, no matter the scope or the nature of the feature.
These guidelines set out in which cases the design must be a <em>public</em>, <em>written</em> and <em>persistent</em> document, rather than a sketch on a white-board in a stand-up meeting.
Just like coding, design is an iterative and collaborative process.
Having a written document allows for discussion and iterations with peers, including across facilities, before the first line of code is typed.
Besides, the written document facilitates the pull request review process.
Having the design already approved, the reviewer will not need to do a design review with the code review, but will just need to make sure that the implementation matches the previously agreed design.
Finally, once written, the document can also serve as (or easily be turned into) a developer documentation for future reference.</p>
<p>Not every feature requires a design document. The benefit it adds must be gauged with the time and effort that goes into it.
Below are the main scenarios when a design document is necessary or not.</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="42%" />
<col width="58%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head">Design Document Needed</th>
<th class="head">Design Document Not Needed</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Large-scope feature - e.g. slice viewer, instrument viewer</li>
<li>Brand-new feature - e.g. crash reporter, plot manager</li>
<li>Core refactors - e.g. HistogramData, DetectorInfo</li>
<li>Abstractions, APIs - e.g. simpleapi, a new workspace type</li>
<li>Fully fledged libraries - e.g. Crystal library in the framework</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Bug fixes of any kind</li>
<li>Minor extensions to the current tools - e.g. adding another button in a GUI widget</li>
<li>New functionalities to an extant algorithm – e.g. another target of unit conversion</li>
<li>Concrete, single-class plugins - e.g. a new algorithm or a new fit function</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Below are a handful of measurable quantities that could help a developer decide which category the feature belongs to.</p>
<div class="section" id="amount-of-classes">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Amount of classes</a><a class="headerlink" href="#amount-of-classes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Single-class plugins, such as algorithms, do not require design documents.
In the contrary, if the number of classes is more than a dozen, the document could be relevant in order to describe the relations between them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="amount-of-files">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Amount of files</a><a class="headerlink" href="#amount-of-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the feature intends to touch (add or edit) a single file, design document is not needed.
If it is more than a hundred, opposite is likely the case.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="abstractness-fraction">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Abstractness fraction</a><a class="headerlink" href="#abstractness-fraction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Stability of a piece of code must be proportional to its abstractness; abstractions and APIs are hard to change, once in.
So whenever the feature concerns creations of new abstraction layers and APIs, a wider discussion on the design is needed, hence the necessity of the document.
A good measure for this is the intended fraction of the abstract classes (virtual or pure virtual) in the design.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-layer-of-intent">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">The layer of intent</a><a class="headerlink" href="#the-layer-of-intent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the feature is deep in the framework or workbench, it is more critical to have a document.
Features in the core layer must be carefully thought out, as many other things will depend on them.
In the contrary, if the feature is just a plugin in the periphery (algorithm, function, GUI, script), with low risk of side effects, a design document is less important.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="number-of-developers">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Number of developers</a><a class="headerlink" href="#number-of-developers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the feature is large enough that the implementation will be done in a distributed way (i.e. more than one developer), the document will ensure that the whole team has a common vision, discussed and agreed upfront.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="number-of-users">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Number of users</a><a class="headerlink" href="#number-of-users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the feature is generic, it will be facing a wider audience of users, hence a document and design review will make sure that the right feature is being built in the right way.
In the contrary, if the feature is specific to one instrument or technique at one facility, producing a document is less important.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="number-of-person-months">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Number of person-months</a><a class="headerlink" href="#number-of-person-months" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Another metric could be the estimated effort in person-months. If the feature is estimated to take a year to develop, it is worth spending a few weeks to iterate and improve on the design.
If the feature is less than one month of work, it’s probably an overkill.</p>
<p>These are just guidelines and not strict rules.
It is hard to define exact thresholds on these quantities, and often your feature is going to be in a grey zone anyway.
Therefore, it is advised to combine all these metrics and make a professional judgement on a case-by-case basis.
Nevertheless, a good intuition on when a document is useful, and when not, comes with experience.
That’s why, whenever in doubt, get in touch with the senior members of the team - the gatekeepers.
A good first contact could be the local team lead at your facility, or the <em>tech-qa</em> channel on slack.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design-document-process">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Design document process</a><a class="headerlink" href="#design-document-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once identified that for a given feature a design document is needed, the process goes as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Create an item in the technical working group roadmap <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mantidproject/roadmap/projects/1">here</a> under the intended release.</li>
<li>Produce the document in <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a> format with the md extension. Once ready for review, open a PR in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/tree/main/Design">here</a> or a subdirectory therein. The pull request should also include the sources (and not just the images) of any diagrams you put in the document. The diagrams can be drawn with <a class="reference external" href="https://staruml.io/">staruml</a> or similar cross-platform or WEB solution.</li>
<li>Once the PR is ready for review, put a message with a link in <em>tech-qa</em> channel, inviting the gatekeepers or other interested parties take a look and provide comments within one calendar week. Unlike the PR for code, the design reviews can and should have more than one assigned reviewer. The period can be extended if the scope is very large.</li>
<li>Answer the comments under the PR and iterate as long as needed.</li>
<li>Once the comments are incorporated, in absence of outstanding conflicts, the gatekeepers will approve and merge the PR of the design, which gives a green light to start the implementation.</li>
<li>If there is still a debate between gatekeepers, the <a class="reference internal" href="TSC.html#tsc"><span class="std std-ref">Technical Steering Committee</span></a> will set up a dedicated meeting, where the author will be invited to present and defend the design, and all the conflicts must be settled ideally via consensus, or in the absence thereof, via majority vote.</li>
<li>Once the implementation PR is opened, the design document must be referenced in the PR message. If the feature required a design document, high is the chance that the implementation PR will require also a developer documentation.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design-document-content">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Design document content</a><a class="headerlink" href="#design-document-content" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We want to avoid a prescriptive approach to design document layout.
Design documents are about communicating design ideas, not a box ticking
exercise, so developers are expected to use their own professional
judgement about what goes into them. We are not providing templates for
this reason. The following are suggestions for sections that one should normally have in a design
document:</p>
<div class="section" id="motivation">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Motivation</a><a class="headerlink" href="#motivation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Why does this design document exist?</li>
<li>What is the overview of the problem?</li>
<li>What use cases exist showing the present issue?</li>
<li>How does this solve the requirements?</li>
<li>Note that, <em>this section should be readable to non-developers</em>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dictionary-of-terms">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Dictionary of Terms</a><a class="headerlink" href="#dictionary-of-terms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Your opportunity to pair abbreviations to longer explanations. This is
not always necessary in documents where there are no special terms to
explain. If you need one, a two column table would be sufficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="potential-solutions">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Potential Solutions</a><a class="headerlink" href="#potential-solutions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is important that you consider a wide range of possible solutions,
and don’t just put forward your favourite. Remember that the design
document is a way of avoiding mistakes before coding, so spend some time
considering how several possibilities could be made to work.</p>
<p>For each potential solution, you should probably consider:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Keep it brief and high-level at this stage</li>
<li>What would the scope of the changes be?</li>
<li>What are the pros/cons of this solution?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chosen-solution">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Chosen Solution</a><a class="headerlink" href="#chosen-solution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You should provide logical reasons why you are choosing to adopt
solution A over solution B, C, D … As the project grows in size, we
may need to be able to understand in the future the reasons why certain
designs have been adopted. If you are unsure which solution would be
best, you may submit the partially complete design document to the <a class="reference internal" href="TSC.html#tsc"><span class="std std-ref">Technical Steering Committee</span></a> for help. Design
is itself an iterative process and documents are frequently not accepted
first time around, so be prepared to make amendments, and don’t take it
personally if corrections are required.</p>
<p>Another thing to include is how can one verify the design? What are the use cases that could be used to prove the viability of the solution?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementation-detail">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Implementation Detail</a><a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-detail" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You could merge this section here with the one above if you wish.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use feedback to correct and clarify.</li>
<li>Add more implementation detail. Diagrams are great, but you don’t
have to use strict UML, and use the appropriate UML diagrams
depending upon the solution. Diagrams should help you and readers to
understand the solution in a simple way, not make it more
complicated.</li>
<li>Could someone else follow the design and implement it based on the document without talking to you?
You may not be the one implementing this, and it’s even more likely that you will not be the only one maintaining it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cheat-sheet-and-checklist">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Cheat Sheet and Checklist</a><a class="headerlink" href="#cheat-sheet-and-checklist" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The guidelines above do not need to be strictly followed, but the following are necessary:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Can non-experts understand the motivation for these changes?</li>
<li>Does your design document link from requirements through the implementation details in a traceable manner?</li>
<li>Can someone else implement this?</li>
<li>What use cases verify that this design works?</li>
<li>Has the <a class="reference internal" href="TSC.html#tsc"><span class="std std-ref">Technical Steering Committee</span></a> approved it?</li>
</ol>
